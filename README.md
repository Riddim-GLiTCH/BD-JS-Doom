Yea, its scuffed. I never said it allowed you to play it well.

So what is this? Its literally just an iframe generator that points to a page that hoses [this project](https://github.com/DaniHRE/jsdoom)
It has nothing to do with the project itself, it literally just opens its website.

> ⚠️ Important <br>
> I will not be offering long term support for this plugin. This plugin was made as a joke and the code is pretty fucking basic as it. <br>
> besides that, I literally did nothing to make this work. All issues should be reported to [`DaniHRE/jsdoom`](https://github.com/DaniHRE/jsdoom) instead.
